# AcCatalog

AcCatalog allows you to mark what items you've already owned and can order from the catalog.

Hosted at [https://ac-catalog.herokuapp.com/](https://ac-catalog.herokuapp.com/).

## To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Seed database data with `mix run priv/repo/seed_files/clothing_seeds.exs` and `mix run priv/repo/seed_files/furniture_seeds.exs`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Ask me for the "SMTP_USERNAME" and "SMTP_PASSWORD" system variables you'll need to send email and create an account :)
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
